        <p class="lead">Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and that's pretty much how those
            born under
            this sign see themselves: first.</p>

        <p>The symbol of Aries is the Ram, and that's both good and bad news. Impulsive Aries might be
            tempted to ram their ideas down everyone's throats without even bothering to ask if they want to
            know. It's these times when you may wish Aries' symbol were a more subdued creature, more lamb
            than ram perhaps. You're not likely to convince the Ram to soften up; these folks are blunt and
            to the point. Along with those qualities comes the sheer force of the Aries nature, a force that
            can actually accomplish a great deal. Much of Aries' drive to compete and to win comes from its
            Cardinal Quality. Cardinal Signs love to get things going, and Aries exemplifies this even
            better than Cancer, Libra or Capricorn.</p>

        <p class="lead">Taurus, the second sign of the zodiac, is all about reward. Unlike the
            Aries love of
            the game, Taurus loves the rewards of the game.</p>

        <p>It's the Bull that serves as the Taurus's mascot, and along with that comes the expectation that
            these folks are bull-headed and stubborn. Yes, they are. Hey, this sign has a Fixed Quality
            attached to it after all, so expect that things will occasionally grind to a halt. That said,
            Taurus doesn√ït start out with the intention of getting stuck. They simply want to get things
            done, and it's that steady, dogged persistence that winds up being viewed as stubbornness. Bulls
            are actually among the most practical and reliable members of the zodiac, and they are happy to
            plod along, as it were, in pursuit of their goals. The good news for Bulls is that once they get
            to the finish line, they'll swaddle themselves in material goods. A self-indulgent beast?
            Perhaps, but if you toiled as laboriously as these folks do, you'd need some goodies, too.</p>
